     <dt>tag</dt>
     <p>A tag is a piece of markup language used to define the beginning and end of an HTML element. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).
        Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
        The opening tag starts with < followed by the tag name and ends with >.
        The closing tag starts with </ followed by the tag name and ends with >.
        Some tags are self-closing (or void elements), meaning they don't require a closing tag.
        Examples of Tags:
        Opening tag: <p>
        Closing tag: </p>
        Self-closing tag: <img /> or <br>
        </p>
     <dt>Element</dt><p><dd>An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (if applicable).
        Elements define the structure and meaning of the content on a web page.
        Some elements are self-contained and don't have closing tags (e.g., <img>, <br>). 
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"></dd></p>

        <h4>Doctypes</h4><dd>The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a statement that defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag, and helps the browser understand how to render the page correctly.</dd>
