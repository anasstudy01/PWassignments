. What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility in search engine results. The importance of SEO lies in increasing organic (non-paid) traffic, enhancing user experience, and helping websites rank higher, which can lead to more visitors and potential customers.

2. Create an HTML document with appropriate <title> and <meta> tags for SEO optimization. Ensure the title is descriptive and the meta description is concise.
<!-- Example SEO-optimized HTML head -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>PhysicsWallah: Quality Online Education for All</title>
  <meta name="description" content="PhysicsWallah offers high-quality online courses and resources for students preparing for competitive exams.">
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>

3. What are the Benefits of Using meta tags?

Improve search engine ranking and visibility.
Provide concise summaries for search results.
Control how web pages are displayed on social media.
Specify character encoding and viewport settings for better accessibility and responsiveness.
4. Create an HTML document that properly incorporates semantic elements like <header>, <article>, <section>, or <nav> to improve SEO and document structure.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>PhysicsWallah: Online Learning Platform</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Learn with PhysicsWallah using structured courses and expert guidance.">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>PhysicsWallah</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="#courses">Courses</a>
      <a href="#about">About</a>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="courses">
      <h2>Our Courses</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>JEE Preparation</h3>
        <p>Comprehensive resources for JEE aspirants.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>NEET Preparation</h3>
        <p>Expert guidance for NEET exams.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>PhysicsWallah is dedicated to affordable education.</p>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 PhysicsWallah</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>


5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.

A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon displayed in the browser tab, bookmarks, and address bar, representing a website.

Example:
<head>
  <!-- ...other head elements... -->
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://www.example.com/favicon.png">
</head>
