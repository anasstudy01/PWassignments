1. Features of HTML6 (Potential/Expected)
HTML6 hasn't been officially released yet (as of 2023), but based on discussions and proposals, here are potential features:

Native Web Components - Better support for custom elements without JavaScript frameworks

Improved Multimedia Controls - Enhanced video/audio APIs and built-in editing capabilities

Advanced Form Controls - More sophisticated input types and validation

Built-in Dark Mode Support - Native handling of color schemes

Enhanced Security Features - Stronger default security protocols

Better Accessibility Integration - More semantic elements and ARIA roles built-in

Improved Performance - Native lazy loading for all resources

3D/AR/VR Support - Built-in support for immersive technologies

Simplified Syntax - Optional closing tags for certain elements

Native State Management - Built-in state handling without JavaScript

2. HTML Entities (5 Commonly Used)
HTML entities are codes used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML or that can't be easily typed on a keyboard.

Common HTML entities:

&lt; - < (less than)

&gt; - > (greater than)

&amp; - & (ampersand)

&nbsp; - Non-breaking space

&copy; - Â© (copyright symbol)

3. Web Accessibility
Definition: Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by all people, regardless of disabilities or impairments.

Why it's essential:

Legal requirements - Many countries have laws mandating accessibility

Inclusivity - Ensures equal access to information for everyone

Business benefits - Expands potential audience/customer base

SEO benefits - Accessible sites often rank better in search engines

Future-proofing - Benefits aging populations and temporary impairments

Benefits for different user groups:

Visual impairments: Screen reader compatibility, proper contrast

Motor impairments: Keyboard navigation, large click targets

Cognitive disabilities: Clear content structure, simple language

Hearing impairments: Captions for audio/video content

4. 3 Ways to Improve HTML Accessibility
Use Semantic HTML: Properly structured content with elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <footer>

Add ARIA Attributes: Use ARIA roles and properties where needed (e.g., aria-label, role="navigation")

Ensure Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements should be focusable and usable with keyboard alone
