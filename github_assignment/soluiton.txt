Q1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, tracks every modification, and helps prevent conflicts and data loss. Version control is essential in software development for collaboration, maintaining history, reverting to previous states, and managing releases.

Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository
- Working Directory: This is where you modify files in your project.
- Staging Area (Index): This is where you place changes you want to commit. You add files to the staging area using `git add`.
- Repository: This is the database where Git permanently stores your commits. You save staged changes to the repository using `git commit`.
The typical workflow is: modify files in the working directory → stage changes → commit to the repository.

Q3. Explain what .gitignore is and why it’s important in version control
.gitignore is a file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore and not track in version control. It is important because it prevents unnecessary files (like build artifacts, logs, or sensitive information) from being committed to the repository, keeping the project clean and secure.

Q4. Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to GitHub.
GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and code review, making it easier for teams to work together and manage version control. Alternatives to GitHub include GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.

Q5. Describe the process of contributing to any open-source project on GitHub in a step-by-step manner.
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
6. Open a pull request to the original repository.
7. Participate in code review and make any requested changes.
8. Once approved, your changes will be merged by the project maintainers.
